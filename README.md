### Better Tab Completion

```bash
# Faster tab completion
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
set completion-ignore-case on

# TAB through the suggestions
TAB:menu-complete

# Move between words with Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right
"\e[1;5D":backward-word
"\e[1;5C":forward-word

# Enable the history search mode
"\e[A":history-search-backward
"\e[B":history-search-forward
"\e[C":forward-char
"\e[D":backward-char

# Enable colors
set colored-stats On
set visible-stats On
set mark-symlinked-directories On
set colored-completion-prefix On
set menu-complete-display-prefix On

# Disables the control echo after pressing Ctrl+C

```

shopt -s histappend

# Check the window size after each command and, if necessary, update the values of LINES and COLUMNS
shopt -s checkwinsize

```
